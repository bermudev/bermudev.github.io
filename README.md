Welcome to the repository for my personal blog!

This blog is built with Astro, a modern static site generator for building fast websites.

Automatic deployment is set up using CI/CD pipelines. Any changes pushed to the main branch will trigger a new deployment.

### Acknowledgment

This blog uses the [Astro Theme Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) with some modifications and personal adaptations.
