      <description>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice where developers write tests before writing the implementation code. Yes, I know it sounds a little crazy, but keep reading!
What is TDD all about? The TDD cycle is really simple and it usually consists of three main steps:
Write a failing test: First, you write a test that specifies the desired behavior of the code you are about to write. This test is expected to fail initially, as the code to fulfill this behavior has not been implemented yet.</description>

      <description>Last month I was talking about code formatters, tools that help to unify styles in our code, making it cleaner, unified, and helping when working in a team.
Now, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how to integrate those tools into our workflow, so that we make sure we always use them. For this we will use what is known as Pre-commit hooks.
What are Pre-commit Hooks? Pre-commit hooks are scripts or tools that run automatically before each commit is made in a version control system, such as Git.</description>
