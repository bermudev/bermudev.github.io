      <description>In recent weeks there has been considerable talk in the Python community about a new linter that may come to replace the already more than consolidated Flake8 or Pylint. This new linter is called Ruff.
What is Ruff? Ruff is a linting tool for Python, that like all other linters, analyzes your code for potential errors, style violations, and other issues that could impact the quality and readability of your code.</description>

      <title>Building a Dog Shelter API with Flask and Python</title>

      <description>One of the first projects I did when I started in the world of backend development was an API for a dog shelter using Django REST Framework, it is one of my first projects and although I remember it fondly I have learned a lot since then.
So I thought, why not try doing something similar using another framework? This way I can take the opportunity to dive more into API development, learn about a different framework and revisit an old project that I&amp;rsquo;m so close to.</description>

      <description>In my professional career I have had to work with large amounts of data and I have been able to learn how to use some analysis tools, one of them is Pandas. So, why don&amp;rsquo;t we take a look at what Pandas is and what it offers us?
What is Pandas? Pandas is a library for data analysis and data manipulation in Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work on structured data seamlessly.</description>
