## Hello and welcome!

I have always been passionate about technology and software development, and in **January 2023**, I have decided to start this blog as a **personal project** for the new year (and hopefully many more!).

## Why writing a blog?

During my time as a software developer I have always relied on other people's **public knowledge** to learn and grow (ahem, ahem, I am looking at you [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)), and I would like to give back a little of what I have learned (and continue to learn) during all this time. 

And I can't think of a better way to do it than writing a blog! So I am excited to start being part of the community, and I hope you will find my content **informative** and **enjoyable**.

## ~~Why Hugo?~~

~~When building this blog, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator. After looking for alternatives and taking advantage of the fact that I had to play around with the Go language at work, it seemed to me the best alternative as it is a simple, fast and flexible framework.~~

~~I also appreciate the large and active community, which provides a lot of resources and themes to customize my website. I'm excited to use it to build my personal blog, and I hope you find the resources and my thoughts fun and informative.~~

## We moved from Hugo... to Astro

At the beginning of 2024 we have stopped using Hugo and moved to Astro üöÄ, you can read all the details and find out the reasons for the change in the [post](/posts/we-are-moving-from-hugo-to-astro/)!

> Thank you for visiting my blog, I look forward to connecting with you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
