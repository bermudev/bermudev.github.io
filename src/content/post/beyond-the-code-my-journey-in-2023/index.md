Now that the current year 2023 is coming to an end I think it would be appropriate to make a small comment about my experience this year and my new wishes for next year.

## Professional Milestones

Professionally I have been able to work on two different projects within the company where I am working, and thanks to this I have been able to acquire knowledge about many technologies that until then were only known to me in theory. 

I have been able to work with microservices, I have acquired even more experience in Docker, API development, working methodologies and so on. But perhaps the most important thing is that I have found a working group that makes work very easy and enjoyable. It is true that there have also been difficulties, since all changes require effort, but there is never growth or development without effort.

## Personal Achievements

On a personal level I also have a very positive balance, I have been able to grow personally, making my relationships with friends and family even more rewarding, and in addition to this I have been able to embark on personal projects that have given me very good results, this blog is one of them!

## Looking Ahead to the New Year

With all this, for the coming year I can only ask for more of the same; more professional development, more personal growth, new friendships, new goals, new challenges...

And finally, as a big fan of Brandon Sanderson that I am, I would like to leave you with another quote from one of my favorite books of his:

> To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one.
