If there is one thing we can agree on, it is that we love acronyms in software development. Today I am going to present three of the most popular basic principles such as **YAGNI**, **KISS** and **DRY**.

Someone may wonder, what about *SOLID*? Well, since each letter of *SOLID* is a principle in itself, it could be enough for a separate post, so maybe later!

It should be noted that sometimes the fact of applying or not these principles is **subordinated** to the project and the code itself, and that sometimes, applying all or some of the principles may be counterproductive, this is why I want to encourage to follow these basics whenever possible but at the same time to have own **criteria** to identify the occasions where their application does more bad than good.

## YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It 
Let's start with the first of them, YAGNI. This principle proposes that you should not add features to your code until you really **need** them. Instead of speculating about what you might need in the future, focus on what you need **now**.

It is not uncommon to come across situations where **unnecessary features** are implemented that we think will be useful, either because it is easy to implement or in an effort to understand the business and speculate on possible future situations.

This would not be too much of a problem if we were sure that these features stay in the code and will be used not too late, but in many cases they are **removed over time** because in the end they are **never used**.

If we take as an example the case where we need to do a sum, the correct code would be:
```python
def addition(a, b):
	return a + b
```

Instead of:
```python
def operations(a, b):
    addition = a + b
    subtraction = a - b
    multiplication = a * b
    division = a / b if b != 0 else None
    return addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
```

We are still doing the sum, but what is the rest for? Are we sure it will be used later?

## KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
Okay, before you accuse me of insults, that's what it's called, I promise. I don't understand this aggressiveness either, but that's how it is.

This principle is very simple (*ba dum tss*): we always have to keep the code **as simple as possible**, avoiding unnecessary complexity. It is easy to understand that simplicity makes the code **easier to read**, **understand** and **maintain**. 

This simplicity can come in many ways, from for example in the **logic** of the code to the way different elements are **named**.

Let's imagine we want to see if a number is even or odd, the KISS way to do it would be:
```python
def is_odd(n): 
	return n % 2 == 0
```

Instead of:
```python
def calculate_if_number_is_odd(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        answer = True
    else:
        answer = False
    return answer
```

Which do you think is better? I think we would all think the same,

## DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
In this case, this principle tells us that we should **avoid duplication** of code, and that if we find ourselves in situations where we have to repeat code, the best thing to consider is to **refactor** and use reusable and specific functions or classes.
If we follow this principle, our code will be much **easier to maintain** and will have **fewer errors**. 

The logic behind this is quite simple, if we have to make a change, how many times would you prefer to do it, once or more than once? If this part of the logic were repeated, we would have to go through each **repetition** making the changes, with the consequent cost of maintenance and the possibility of generating human errors.

As an example, let's imagine we are making API requests in various places in your code. We could do it like this:
```python
import requests

response1 = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data1')
data1 = response1.json()

response2 = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data2')
data2 = response2.json()
```

Or we could make a function that is in charge of making the request and getting the data:
```python
import requests

def get_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

data1 = get_data('https://api.example.com/data1')
data2 = get_data('https://api.example.com/data2')
```
That's better, isn't it?
