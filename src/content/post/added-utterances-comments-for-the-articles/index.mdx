## I am excited to announce that comments have been enabled on the posts!

For me, one of the main features I like most about blogs is being able to comment and share knowledge. After studying several options I have decided that [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is the best option and the one I like the most for the cause.

[Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is a lightweight and fast commenting system that integrates with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues). I believe that [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is a great choice for the website and want to share why I consider it better than other commenting systems like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) and [Cactus Comments](https://cactus.chat/).

## Why I think Utterances is better than other commenting systems

1. **Privacy and Data Ownership**: Utterances doesn't track your visitors and it doesn't store any personal data, unlike [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) and [Cactus Comments](https://cactus.chat/). With Utterances, you keep full control over your data and visitors' data.

2. **Speed and Performance**: Utterances is lightweight and fast, it loads comments asynchronously and it doesn't slow down your website.

3. **Integration with GitHub Issues**: Utterances is fully integrated with GitHub Issues, meaning that comments are stored in a GitHub repository, and this allows you to easily moderate and manage comments.

4. **Open Source**: Utterances is open-source software, meaning that you can see exactly how it works and make changes to it if needed. This allows you to have complete control over your commenting system.

5. **Easy to set up**: Utterances is easy to set up and it only requires a small amount of code to add comments to your website.

I hope you enjoy the new commenting system and look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on the articles.
