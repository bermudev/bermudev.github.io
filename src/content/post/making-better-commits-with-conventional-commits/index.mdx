One of the first concerns I had when I started learning about Git and version control was how to **name** commits. Could I put anything? Anything would do? Luckily, I got an answer soon after.

<div className="flex justify-center">
	<Image src={git_commit} alt="xkcd commit joke" width="400px" />
</div>

Today I'm here to talk briefly about [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), a **standard** for naming commits that helps us all understand each other better.

Although it's not the way I originally started naming the commits of this blog's repo, I've used it during all my **professional career** and in almost all the rest of the repositories except for this one (like for example the repository from my project of the [Dog Shelter API](https://bermu.dev/posts/building-a-dog-shelter-api-with-flask-and-python/)), but now I've decided that for convenience I'm going to apply it here too, so why not talk a bit about it?

## What are Conventional Commits?

*Conventional Commits is a convention for commits*. 

I'm a genius. End of post.

Okay, I'm kidding. But something like this. Their same [web](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) defines it as:

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

In short, it's a way to name commits so that we're all on the **same page** and to make logs easier to read, among other things.

## What is it about?

Actually this specification is quite simple, to name a commit we need to follow a specific structure: we need to indicate a **type**, an optional **scope**, and a **description**. In addition to the name we can include a body and a footer.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
The use of these **types** is defined according to certain criteria:

```
type: Specifies the nature of the change and can be one of the following:
	
    feat: A new feature
	fix: A bug fix
	docs: Changes to documentation
	style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
	refactor: Refactoring of code without functional changes
	test: Adding or fixing tests
	chore: Updating of build tasks or auxiliary tools, etc

scope: (Optional) Indicates the part of the code affected (e.g. api, core, ui).

description: A brief description of the change made.
```

If we apply this, some **examples** of commit names that follow this specification would be:

```
feat(api): add endpoint to get users
fix(auth): fix token validation error
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(core): format code according to new PEP8 rules
refactor(ui): simplify search component logic
test(core): add tests for login functionality
chore(deps): update project dependencies
```

## Integrating with gitmoji

If we want, we can also **integrate** Conventional Commits with another commit convention (yes... I know) like [Gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji), whis is an initiative to standardize and explain the use of **emojis** on GitHub commit messages. 

This way, each type of commit corresponds to an emoji placed **just after the semicolon and before the description**:

- feat(): ✨ -> `:sparkles:`
- fix(): 🐛 -> `:bug:`
- docs(): 📚 -> `:books:`
- style(): 💎 -> `:gem:`
- refactor(): 🔨 -> `:hammer:`
- perf(): 🚀 -> `:rocket:`
- test(): 🚨 -> `:rotating_light:`
- build(): 📦 -> `:package:`
- ci(): 👷 -> `:construction_worker:`
- chore(): 🔧 -> `:wrench:`


## Addons and tools

As I mentioned before, another advantage of this format is that being formatted in a standardized way, it allows us to create **useful tools** around it. 

Examples of tools based on this are:

- [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff): a tool that allows us to **generate changelog** files from the Git history.
- [convco](https://convco.github.io/): a useful **commit cli** built with Rust.
- [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/): a release **management tool** designed for teams.

If you want, you can see many many more in this part of their [official website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/#tooling-for-conventional-commits).
