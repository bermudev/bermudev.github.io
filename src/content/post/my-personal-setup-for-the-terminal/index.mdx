Hello everyone! It's been a busy few weeks, I'm studying a lot about Machine Learning and I don't have too much time to write or share my progress. However, I had to set up a new development environment and I thought, why not share a bit of my setup?

So here's how to choose a shell, how to set up my favorite prompt and font, and some personal aliases I commonly use!

## Choosing a Shell

The first thing I like to do is to choose a shell for my terminal. The three most common Linux shells that I have been able to test in the past are:

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (Bourne-Again SHell): This is the default shell for most Linux distributions. It is a powerful and versatile shell with a wide range of features and capabilities.

- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (Z Shell): This is a highly customizable shell that is popular among power users. It offers advanced features like tab completion and spelling correction and has an amazing community.

- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) (Friendly Interactive SHell): This is a user-friendly shell that is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. It has a simple syntax and offers many helpful features like syntax highlighting.

In many cases I have chosen to stay with [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) because it is the most widely used command interpreter and therefore well supported by the Linux community, but also because [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is the default command interpreter for most Linux distributions, so it is already installed on the system and usually suits my needs for simple projects.

However, in most cases and especially in cases where I expect to work long term or make extensive use of the interpreter, I like to choose [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) because of the amount of options, plugins, and extensions it offers.

That's why for this post I am going to use [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as an example.

### How to install Zsh and set it as the default shell

Installing Zsh is quite easy but can be tricky.:

1. It is usually possible to install Zsh from the package manager of your distribution using one of these commands:

- For **Ubuntu**, **Debian** & derivatives:

```bash
apt install zsh
```

- For **Arch Linux** or **Manjaro**:

```bash
pacman -S zsh
```

- For **Fedora**:

```bash
dnf install zsh
```

2. Make it your default shell: `chsh -s $(which zsh)` or use sudo `lchsh $USER` if you are on Fedora.
3. Log out and log back in again to use your new default shell.
4. Test that it worked with `echo $SHELL`. Expected result: `/bin/zsh` or similar.
5. Test with `$SHELL --version`. Expected result: 'zsh 5.8' or similar

### Zsh on steroids: Zim

[Zim](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw) is a Zsh configuration framework that bundles a plugin manager, useful modules, and a wide variety of themes, without compromising on speed.

	<Image src={zim} alt="Zim logo" width="300px" />
</div>

Installing Zim is easy. You can choose either the automatic or [manual method](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#manual-installation) refered in their documentation.

For the automatic install, we can use **curl** or **wget** and parse the installation script, this will install a predefined set of modules and a theme:

- With `curl`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
```

- With `wget`:

```bash
wget -nv -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
```

Restart the terminal and we're done. Enjoy Zsh IMproved! Take some time to tweak the [`~/.zshrc`](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#set-up-zshrc) file, and to also check the available
[modules](https://zimfw.sh/docs/modules/) and [themes](https://zimfw.sh/docs/themes/) we can add to [`~/.zimrc`](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#create-zimrc).

## Installing a Nerd Font

After setting up the shell and my favourite framework I always install my favorite [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). And what is a **Nerd Font**? Well, Nerd Fonts are special fonts that patc developer targeted fonts with a high number of glyphs (icons).

<div className="flex justify-center">
	<Image src={firacode} alt="FiraCode font" width="300px" />
</div>

There is a wide variety of Nerd Fonts, but my favourite is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Fira Code is a monospaced font that includes programming ligatures, which can make your code more readable.

So, to install this font on Linux, follow these steps:

1. Download the **Patched** Fira Code font from the [official repository](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (or any other font that you like more!).
2. Extract the font files to a folder on your system.
3. Copy the font files to the `~/.fonts` folder.
4. Run the command `fc-cache -fv` to manually rebuild the font cache.

Alternatively, you can use [this script](https://github.com/mcarvalho1/Nerd-fonts-Downloader-Script) to install any Nerd Font you liked automatically (or any amount of them if you want more than one for any reason).

Now you can have a pretty and nice prompt with a lot of information!

## The Starship Prompt

Another tool that I want to introduce is the **[Starship](https://starship.rs/)** prompt. This is a customizable and fast shell prompt written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) that displays useful information in the terminal, like useful system information, Git repository or virtual environment.

<div className="flex justify-center">
	<Image src={starship} alt="Starship logo" width="300px" />
</div>

It can be installed in many ways depending on the operating system and shell. In this case, I will explain the installation as a Zim module and as standalone.

### Install as a Zim module

Add Starship to your `.zimrc`:
```bash
zmodule joke/zim-starship
```

Then install Starship:
```bash
zimfw install
```

### Standalone installation

To install Starship in a linux system with a bash or zsh shell:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh)"
```

2. Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` for zsh or `~/.bashrc` for bash):

```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

That's it! Easy, right?

Now you can have a pretty and nice prompt with a lot of information! If you want more customization you can try to customize the Starship prompt by editing the `~/.config/starship.toml` file. This file contains a number of settings that you can tweak to your liking, you can learn more about it [here](https://starship.rs/config/).
