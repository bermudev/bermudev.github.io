Hello everyone! It's been a busy few weeks, I'm studying a lot about Machine Learning and I don't have too much time to write or share my progress. However, I had to set up a new development environment and I thought, why not share a bit of my setup?

So here's how to choose a **shell**, how to set up my favorite **prompt** and **font**, and some more personal **tools** I commonly use!

## Choosing a Shell

The first thing I like to do is to choose a shell for my terminal. The three most common Linux shells that I have been able to test in the past are:

- [**Bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (*Bourne-Again SHell*): This is the default shell for most Linux distributions. It is a powerful and versatile shell with a wide range of features and capabilities.

- [**Zsh**](https://www.zsh.org/) (*Z Shell*): This is a highly customizable shell that is popular among power users. It offers advanced features like tab completion and spelling correction and has an amazing community.

- [**Fish**](https://fishshell.com/) (*Friendly Interactive SHell*): This is a user-friendly shell that is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. It has a simple syntax and offers many helpful features like syntax highlighting.

In many cases I have chosen to stay with [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) because it is the most widely used command interpreter and therefore well supported by the Linux community, but also because [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is commonly the default command interpreter for most Linux distributions, so it is usually already installed on the system and usually suits my needs for **simple projects**.

However, in most cases and especially in cases where I expect to work **long term** or make **extensive use** of the interpreter, I like to choose [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) because of the amount of options, plugins, and extensions it offers.

That's why for this post I am going to use [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as an example.

### How to install Zsh and set it as the default shell

Installing Zsh is quite easy but can be tricky.:

1. It is usually possible to install Zsh from the package manager of your distribution using one of these commands:

- For **Ubuntu**, **Debian** & derivatives:

```bash
apt install zsh
```

- For **Arch Linux** or **Manjaro**:

```bash
pacman -S zsh
```

- For **Fedora**:

```bash
dnf install zsh
```

2. Make it your default shell: `chsh -s $(which zsh)` or use sudo `lchsh $USER` if you are on Fedora.
3. Log out and log back in again to use your new default shell.
4. Test that it worked with `echo $SHELL`. Expected result: `/bin/zsh` or similar.
5. Test with `$SHELL --version`. Expected result: 'zsh 5.8' or similar

### Zsh on steroids: Zim

[Zim](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw) is a Zsh **configuration framework** that bundles a **plugin manager**, useful **modules**, and a wide variety of **themes**, without compromising on speed.

	<Image src={zim} alt="Zim logo" width="300px" />
</div>

Installing Zim is easy. You can choose either the automatic or [manual method](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#manual-installation) refered in their documentation.

For the automatic install, we can use **curl** or **wget** and parse the installation script, this will install a predefined set of modules and a theme:

- With `curl`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
```

- With `wget`:

```bash
wget -nv -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
```

Restart the terminal and we're done. Enjoy **Zsh IMproved**! Take some time to tweak the [`~/.zshrc`](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#set-up-zshrc) file, and to also check the available
[modules](https://zimfw.sh/docs/modules/) and [themes](https://zimfw.sh/docs/themes/) we can add to [`~/.zimrc`](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#create-zimrc).

## Installing a Nerd Font

After setting up the shell and my favorite framework I always install my favorite [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). And what is a **Nerd Font**? Well, Nerd Fonts are special fonts that takes regular fonts and patch them with a high number of glyphs (icons).

<div className="flex justify-center">
	<Image src={firacode} alt="FiraCode font" width="300px" />
</div>

There is a wide variety of **Nerd Fonts**, but my favorite version is the one that patches the font called [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Fira Code is a monospaced font that includes programming **ligatures**, which can make your code more readable.

So, to install this font on Linux, follow these steps:

1. Download the **Nerd Font version** of the Fira Code font from the [official repository](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (or any other font that you like more!).
2. Extract the font files to a folder on your system.
3. Copy the font files to the `~/.fonts` folder.
4. Run the command `fc-cache -fv` to manually rebuild the font cache.

Alternatively, you can use [this script](https://github.com/mcarvalho1/Nerd-fonts-Downloader-Script) to install any **Nerd Font** you like automatically (or any amount of them if you want more than one for any reason, huh).

Now you can have a pretty and nice prompt with a lot of information!

## The Starship Prompt

Another tool that I want to introduce is the [**Starship**](https://starship.rs/) **prompt**. This is a customizable and fast **shell prompt** written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) that displays useful information in the terminal, like useful **system information**, **Git repository** or **virtual environment**.

<div className="flex justify-center">
	<Image src={starship} alt="Starship logo" width="300px" />
</div>

It can be installed in many ways depending on the operating system and shell. In this case, I will explain the installation as a **Zim module** and as **standalone**.

### Install as a Zim module

Add Starship to your `.zimrc`:
```bash
zmodule joke/zim-starship
```

Then install Starship:
```bash
zimfw install
```

### Standalone installation

To install Starship in a linux system with a bash or zsh shell:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh)"
```

2. Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` for zsh or `~/.bashrc` for bash):

```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

That's it! Easy, right?

Now you can have a pretty and nice prompt with a lot of information! 

If you want more customization you can try to customize the Starship prompt by editing the `~/.config/starship.toml` file. This file contains a number of settings that you can tweak to your liking, you can learn more about it [here](https://starship.rs/config/).
