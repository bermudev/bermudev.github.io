We all know that data protection is a crucial aspect of our daily work. The ability to recover from data loss or hardware failures is a must-have for any serious software development project. 

One of the best ways to ensure data protection is by using backup software like [Restic](https://restic.net/). In this post, I will show you how to set up backups with [Restic](https://restic.net/), and why I think it's a great choice for my data protection needs.

## What is Restic?

[Restic](https://restic.net/) is a command-line backup program that is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. It is written in Go (like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)!) and it's completely open-source. And some of the main features of [Restic](https://restic.net/) include:

- **Deduplication**: it uses a content-defined chunking algorithm to split files into chunks, and it only stores unique chunks, this allows you to save a lot of storage space.

- **Encryption**: Restic obviously supports encryption, which allows you to protect your data from unauthorized access.

- **Compression**: it uses the lz4 compression algorithm to compress data before storing it.

- **Multiple Backends**: it can be used with various storage backends such as local, S3, and SFTP.

## Restic has been audited by a Google employee

[Restic](https://restic.net/) has been audited by Filippo Valsorda, a Google cryptography engineer, you can read more about it [in his personal blog](https://words.filippo.io/restic-cryptography/). The auditing process focused on the core functionality of [Restic](https://restic.net/) and its cryptographic implementation, and it found that [Restic](https://restic.net/) is secure and well-designed.

## Setting up Backups with Restic

So, let's get to work! In this case, it is assumed that the system already has [Restic](https://restic.net/) installed since in each system it is done in a different way, in case you do not know how to do it, you can check [the official documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html).

In addition, the example considers a local copy, however [Restic](https://restic.net/) stands out for its great compatibility with other cloud systems such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/). Again, consult the [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html)!

1. Once you have [Restic](https://restic.net/) installed, you will need to create a new repository for your backups. This can be done by running the following command:

``` sh
restic init --repo /path/to/repo
```

2. After creating your repository, you can create a backup of a folder by running the following command:

```sh
restic backup /path/to/folder --repo /path/to/repo
```

3. I fyou want to check and view the list of backups in your repository, you can use the following command:

```sh
restic snapshots --repo
```

4. And finally, to restore a specific backup, you can use the following command:

```sh
restic restore ID --target /path/to/restore --repo /path/to/repo
```

That's the basics of Restic, if you want to know more... you know where to go, [right](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)?
