As a software developer, data protection is a crucial aspect of our daily work. The ability to recover from data loss or hardware failures is a must-have for any serious software development project. One of the best ways to ensure data protection is by using backup software like [Restic](https://restic.net/). In this article, I will show you how to set up backups with [Restic](https://restic.net/), and why it's a great choice for your data protection needs.

## What is Restic?

[Restic](https://restic.net/) is a command-line backup program that is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. It is written in Go (like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)!) and it's completely open-source. Some of the main features of [Restic](https://restic.net/) include:

- **Deduplication**: Restic uses a content-defined chunking algorithm to split files into chunks, and it only stores unique chunks, this allows you to save a lot of storage space.

- **Encryption**: Restic supports encryption, which allows you to protect your data from unauthorized access.

- **Compression**: Restic uses the lz4 compression algorithm to compress data before storing it.

- **Multiple Backends**: Restic supports various storage backends such as local, S3, and SFTP.

## Restic has been audited by a Google employee

[Restic](https://restic.net/) has been audited by Filippo Valsorda, a Google cryptography engineer, you can read more about it [here](https://words.filippo.io/restic-cryptography/) in his personal blog . The auditing process focused on the core functionality of [Restic](https://restic.net/) and its cryptographic implementation, and it found that [Restic](https://restic.net/) is secure and well-designed.

## Setting up Backups with Restic

In this case, it is assumed that the system already has [Restic](https://restic.net/) installed, since in each system it is done in a different way, in case you do not know how to do it, you can check it [here](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/020_installation.html).

In addition, the example considers a local copy, however [Restic](https://restic.net/) stands out for its great compatibility with other cloud systems such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/). Again, consult the [documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html)!

1. Once you have [Restic](https://restic.net/) installed, you will need to create a new repository for your backups. This can be done by running the following command:

``` sh
restic init --repo /path/to/repo
```

2. After creating your repository, you can create a backup of a folder by running the following command:

```sh
restic backup /path/to/folder --repo /path/to/repo
```

3. To view the list of backups in your repository, you can use the following command:

```sh
restic snapshots --repo
```

4. Finally, to restore a specific backup, you can use the following command:

```sh
restic restore ID --target /path/to/restore --repo /path/to/repo
```
