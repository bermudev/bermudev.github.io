## Hello and welcome!

I have always been passionate about technology and software development, and in January 2023, I have decided to start this blog as a personal project for the new year (and hopefully many more!).

## Why writing a blog?

During my time as a software developer I have always relied on other people's public knowledge to learn and grow (ahem, ahem, I am looking at you [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)), and I would like to give back a little of what I have learned (and continue to learn) during all this time. 

And I can't think of a better way to do it than writing a blog! So I am excited to start being part of the community, and I hope you will find my content informative and enjoyable.

## ~~Why Hugo?~~

~~When building this blog, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator. After looking for alternatives and taking advantage of the fact that I had to play around with the Go language at work, it seemed to me the best alternative as it is a simple, fast and flexible framework.~~

~~I also appreciate the large and active community, which provides a lot of resources and themes to customize my website. I'm excited to use it to build my personal blog, and I hope you find the resources and my thoughts fun and informative.~~

## We moved from Hugo... to Astro

At the beginning of 2024 we have stopped using Hugo and moved to Astro, you can read more and find out the reasons for the change in the [post](https://gohugo.io/)!

> Thank you for visiting my blog, I look forward to connecting with you! ❤️
