## Hello and welcome!

I have always been passionate about technology and software development, and I have decided to start this blog as a personal project for the new year.

## Why writing a blog?

As a software developer, I know how important it is to continuously learn and grow. I believe that blogging is a great way to do that as it allows me to reflect on what I have learned, share my knowledge with others, and learn from others in the community. I am excited to be a part of this community, and I hope you will find my content informative and enjoyable.

## We moved from Hugo... to Astro

~~When it comes to building this blog, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as my static site generator. I found it to be simple, fast and flexible. I also appreciate the large and active community, which provides plenty of resources and themes to customize my website. I am excited to use it to build my personal blog and I hope you find it fun and informative.~~

At the beginning of 2024 we have stopped using Hugo and moved to Astro, you can read more and find out the reasons in the [post](https://gohugo.io/)!

> Thank you for visiting my blog, I look forward to connecting with you! ❤️
