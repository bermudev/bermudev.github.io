      <description>These past few days that I have been studying and learning a lot about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I have been able to read a lot of documentation, but I have also come across some interesting videos on YouTube.
What is the problem with this? The main problem is that YouTube is known for having certain ease in deleting videos. That is why I have decided to use one of my favorite tools to save a local copy of these videos (just in case).</description>

      <description>In recent weeks there has been considerable talk in the Python community about a new linter that may come to replace the already more than consolidated Flake8 or Pylint. This new linter is called Ruff.
What is Ruff? Ruff is a linting tool for Python, that like all other linters, analyzes your code for potential errors, style violations, and other issues that could impact the quality and readability of your code.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m studying a lot about Machine Learning and I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much time to write or share my progress. However, I had to set up a new development environment and I thought, why not share a bit of my setup?
So here&amp;rsquo;s how to choose a shell, how to set up my favorite prompt, font and some personal aliases I commonly use!</description>

      <description>One of the first projects I did when I started in the world of backend development was an API for a dog shelter using Django REST Framework, it is one of my first projects and although I remember it fondly I have learned a lot since then.
So I thought, why not try doing something similar using another framework? This way I can take the opportunity to dive more into API development, learn about a different framework and revisit an old project that I&amp;rsquo;m so close to.</description>

      <description>In my professional career I have had to work with large amounts of data and I have been able to learn how to use some analysis tools, one of them is Pandas. So, why don&amp;rsquo;t we take a look at what Pandas is and what it offers us?
What is Pandas? Pandas is a library for data analysis and data manipulation in Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work on structured data seamlessly.</description>

      <description>The first thing I remember when I started to understand databases is that I thought there was only one type of non-relational database. Wrong! It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that NoSQL databases are not a single type of database, but rather a category that encompasses several different types of databases.
Some of the most popular types of NoSQL databases include:
Document databases: These databases store data in the form of documents, such as JSON or XML.</description>

      <description>As a software developer, data protection is a crucial aspect of our daily work. The ability to recover from data loss or hardware failures is a must-have for any serious software development project. One of the best ways to ensure data protection is by using backup software like Restic. In this article, I will show you how to set up backups with Restic, and why it&amp;rsquo;s a great choice for your data protection needs.</description>

      <title>Added Utterances comments for the articles</title>

      <description>I am excited to announce that comments have been enabled on the articles! For me, one of the main features I like most about blogs is being able to comment and share knowledge. After studying several options I have decided that Utterances is the best option and the one I like the most for the cause.
Utterances is a lightweight and fast commenting system that integrates with GitHub Issues. I believe that Utterances is a great choice for the website and want to share why I consider it better than other commenting systems like Disqus and Cactus Comments.</description>

      <title>Welcome to my software development blog</title>
      <link>https://bermu.dev/posts/my-first-post/</link>

      <description>Hello and welcome! I have always been passionate about technology and software development, and I have decided to start this blog as a personal project for the new year.
Why writing a blog? As a software developer, I know how important it is to continuously learn and grow. I believe that blogging is a great way to do that as it allows me to reflect on what I have learned, share my knowledge with others, and learn from others in the community.</description>
