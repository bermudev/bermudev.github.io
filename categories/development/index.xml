      <description>For the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been forced to use Windows (I know, it&amp;rsquo;s a long story) and thus leave behind my Linux development environment. However, for some time now, Windows has offered the opportunity to integrate Linux systems into the desktop more or less natively through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
The thing is, although major distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSuse, or even Kali Linux offer support, not all distributions make it easy to use this feature.</description>

      <title>Using Pyenv to Manage Different Python Versions</title>

      <description>When working with different projects it is common to have different versions of the same programming language and dependencies for each one of them, so if we had a single installation or global version, this could give constant conflict between different projects.
To fix that we can use tools like pyenv and virtual environments. What these tools do is to isolate different versions of python and different installations (environments) of each of these versions.</description>

      <title>Building a Dog Shelter API with Flask and Python</title>

      <description>One of the first projects I did when I started in the world of backend development was an API for a dog shelter using Django REST Framework, it is one of my first projects and although I remember it fondly I have learned a lot since then.
So I thought, why not try doing something similar using another framework? This way I can take the opportunity to dive more into API development, learn about a different framework and revisit an old project that I&amp;rsquo;m so close to.</description>
