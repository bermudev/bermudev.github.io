      <description>One of the first projects I did when I started in the world of backend development was an API for a dog shelter using Django REST Framework, it is one of my first projects and although I remember it fondly I have learned a lot since then.
So I thought, why not try doing something similar using another framework? This way I can take the opportunity to dive more into API development, learn about a different framework and revisit an old project that I&amp;rsquo;m so close to.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome! I have always been passionate about technology and software development, and I have decided to start this blog as a personal project for the new year.
Why writing a blog? As a software developer, I know how important it is to continuously learn and grow. I believe that blogging is a great way to do that as it allows me to reflect on what I have learned, share my knowledge with others, and learn from others in the community.</description>
