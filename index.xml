      <title>Building a Dog Shelter API with Flask and Python</title>

      <description>One of the first projects I did when I started in the world of backend development was an API for a dog shelter using Django REST Framework, it is one of my first projects and although I remember it fondly I have learned a lot since then.
So I thought, why not try doing something similar using another framework? This way I can take the opportunity to dive more into API development, learn about a different framework and revisit an old project that I&amp;rsquo;m so close to.</description>

      <description>In my professional career I have had to work with large amounts of data and I have been able to learn how to use some analysis tools, one of them is Pandas. So, why don&amp;rsquo;t we take a look at what Pandas is and what it offers us?
What is Pandas? Pandas is a library for data analysis and data manipulation in Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work on structured data seamlessly.</description>

      <description>The first thing I remember when I started to understand databases is that I thought there was only one type of non-relational database. Wrong! It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that NoSQL databases are not a single type of database, but rather a category that encompasses several different types of databases.
Some of the most popular types of NoSQL databases include:
Document databases: These databases store data in the form of documents, such as JSON or XML.</description>

      <description>As a software developer, data protection is a crucial aspect of our daily work. The ability to recover from data loss or hardware failures is a must-have for any serious software development project. One of the best ways to ensure data protection is by using backup software like Restic. In this article, I will show you how to set up backups with Restic, and why it&amp;rsquo;s a great choice for your data protection needs.</description>

      <description>I am excited to announce that comments have been enabled on the articles! For me, one of the main features I like most about blogs is being able to comment and share knowledge. After studying several options I have decided that Utterances is the best option and the one I like the most for the cause.
Utterances is a lightweight and fast commenting system that integrates with GitHub Issues. I believe that Utterances is a great choice for the website and want to share why I consider it better than other commenting systems like Disqus and Cactus Comments.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome! I have always been passionate about technology and software development, and I have decided to start this blog as a personal project for the new year.
Why writing a blog? As a software developer, I know how important it is to continuously learn and grow. I believe that blogging is a great way to do that as it allows me to reflect on what I have learned, share my knowledge with others, and learn from others in the community.</description>
