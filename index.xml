      <description>I am excited to announce that comments have been enabled on the articles! For me, one of the main features I like most about blogs is being able to comment and share knowledge. After studying several options I have decided that Utterances is the best option and the one I like the most for the cause.
Utterances is a lightweight and fast commenting system that integrates with GitHub Issues. I believe that Utterances is a great choice for the website and want to share why I consider it better than other commenting systems like Disqus and Cactus Comments.</description>

      <description>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I am so excited to share a bit about myself with you. I am a backend developer and I graduated in Industrial Engineering in Seville. I have always been passionate about technology and software development and have been working on it remotely over the last few years.
I have a few favorite things when it comes to technology, and I love working with Python and Linux. I also have a strong interest in API development and cybersecurity.</description>
