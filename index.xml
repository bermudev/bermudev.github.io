      <description>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I am so excited to share a bit about myself with you. I am a backend developer and I graduated in Industrial Engineering in Seville. I have always been passionate about technology and software development and have been working on it remotely over the last few years.
I have a few favorite things when it comes to technology, and I love working with Python and Linux. I also have a strong interest in API development and cybersecurity.</description>
