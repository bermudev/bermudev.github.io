      <description>I am excited to announce that comments have been enabled on the articles! For me, one of the main features I like most about blogs is being able to comment and share knowledge. After studying several options I have decided that Utterances is the best option and the one I like the most for the cause.
Utterances is a lightweight and fast commenting system that integrates with GitHub Issues. I believe that Utterances is a great choice for the website and want to share why I consider it better than other commenting systems like Disqus and Cactus Comments.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome! I have always been passionate about technology and software development, and I have decided to start this blog as a personal project for the new year.
Why writing a blog? As a software developer, I know how important it is to continuously learn and grow. I believe that blogging is a great way to do that as it allows me to reflect on what I have learned, share my knowledge with others, and learn from others in the community.</description>
